If you read this before we fix the openai API connection, if you scroll down in the textcode.js you will find the code that is supposed to be in route.
Right now I have some sample code from chatgpt instead just to see if we can get connected to the API. 
Once we solve the issue I will delete the contents of route.js and replace it with what I have pasted at the bottom of textcode.js
